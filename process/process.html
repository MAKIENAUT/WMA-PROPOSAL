                     criteria. Therefore, our candidates have to undergo a very
                     selective process before we contact the sponsor for final
                     screening and selection. Our managers directly correspond with
                     the sponsor and selected candidates during this process.

                      You will need some critical documents right when you enter
                      the country, others only after you arrive. But once you’re
                      in the United States, obtaining records from the
                      authorities back home will be tedious. Therefore, you
                      should check everything carefully before you go. Some
                      sponsors are present once you land at the airport.
